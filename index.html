            Born with a love for problem solving, I naturally found a love for science. I completed my Bachelors in
            chemistry in 2011, and worked a few years in industry as a chemist but quickly realized I had a different
            calling. While I was researching alternative career paths, a friend of mine suggested that I get into
            software development and the rest was history.

            I completed <a target="_blank" href="http://www.makersquare.com/">MakerSquare's</a> 12 week immersive software development
            program in November 2014 with a focus on server side software development. During the immersive course I
            developed a proficiency in:

        In my free time I like to get a healthy dose of vitamin D by exploring the never-ending list of places to swim,
        hike and bike around Austin with my friends and dog, Benson. I'm always on the hunt to find the best burger in
        Texas and must say that <a href="http://stackhouseburgers.com/">Stackhouse</a> in Dallas currently holds that title.
        I'm also an avid motorcycle rider and frequently venture outside of town in an effort to discover a small fraction
        of the 300,000 miles of roadway here in Texas.

            GooBrr.com is a Bar/Restaurant/Food finding web application. Using the browsers Geolocation support
            and a user defined radius and search term, GooBrr will find business that match the criteria and give
            the user the option to either add the business to a results queue or pass. When the user runs out of
            businesses that are available or whenever they would like to see their results, a side menu containing
            all of the queued business that were a potential businesses will appear. The user can then narrow down
            their list by removing a business from the list, or click to see directions at any time. The user is then
            presented with directions from their current location and they also have the option to have the directions
            sent to them via text message by entering their phone number.

            I was inspired to develop this web application after continually being displeased with using Google Maps, which
            will populate a map based off of a search term with matching locations around you, but you have to select each one
            individually, which can be overwhelming in a dense metro area.
          </p>
          <p>
            The technology that went into this web application starts with node.js and Express.js serving a single GET route as
            a single page application. On the client side, the users location is determined by the browsers support for geolocation,
            and if upon failing the user is prompted to input their address, which will then locate them using Google Maps API. Upon
            submitting the initial parameters, they are posted to the web sever, which then makes a Yelp API request returns the data
            to the client. The data is manipulated in an array on the client side using AngularJS remove businesses or add them to a
            selected business array. Due a 20 business limitation from the Yelp API, subsequent requests are sent with an offset parameter
            to locate more businesses when the user has exhausted the businesses in the current request. The directions are handled
            through Google Maps API using the latitude and longitude of the client provided from the initial browser geolocation and the
            latitude and longitude of the business as provided from the Yelp API. The texting service is handled by a API request to
            TextBelt using a user provided phone number.

      <h3><a target="_blank" href="http://jumbalya.herokuapp.com">Jumbalya</a></h3>
      <h6>Launched to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> on November 19, 2014.</h6>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="large-6 columns">

            Jumbalya was originally written as a Ruby text scrambling method (no password) that I wrote in a night for fun. It worked by
            taking the original input text and assigning a numerical 2 digit code to each character (e.g. A = 96 and ! = 99), then performing
            a number of systematic shifts, it converted the input into something visually similar to what it returns now. I sat on the method
            for a few months until I was finished at MakerSquare before I decided to build it out into a full blown web application with some
            added modifications that I picked up along the way.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="large-6 columns">

            <img class='project' src="images/jumbalya.png"/>

        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <p>
            One of the things I discovered along the way was SHA-1, a cryptographic hash function that irreversibly but consistently converts
            any text input into a 40 character hexadecimal number. I decided to implement this into my original design by digesting a salted
            password with SHA-1, then use the hexadecimal output to control both the shifts performed for the encryption method and the shifts
            on where to grab the next value from the SHA-1 hash value. Long story short, I'm confident that someone using anything other than
            brute-force attack, couldn't decrypt the output. But I'll buy you a cookie if you can. Lastly, if for some reason I decide to change
            the encryption method somewhere down the road, I added in some reverse compatibility by prefixing every output with 'aa'. The original
            decryption method will recognize the prefix and work accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a working method in place, I decided to deploy 'Jumbalya' as a web application on Heroku with a Sinatra back-end serving it
            as a single page application with two post routes for the encryption and unencryption methods and AngularJS and Bootstrap to tie the
            front-end together.

          <p>
             With my dad's upcoming retirement, I built RogueRodShop.com for him to help advertise the cars he loves to build in his spare time.
             The goals I had for this website were that it had to be a static site and the day to day operations had to be handled by him. After
             searching through static site generators, I found that Jekyll would be an excellent tool to build his website. I then built the overall
             layout design that he would need for his business and created a command line interface (CLI) for him to add, remove and edit the projects
             on the site. I made the CLI as user friendly as possible, making any change to the website a breeze.
