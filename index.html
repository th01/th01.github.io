            GooBrr.com is a Bar/Restaurant/Food finding web application. Using the browsers Geolocation support 
            and a user defined radius and search term, GooBrr will find business that match the criteria and give 
            the user the option to either add the business to a results queue or pass. When the user runs out of 
            businesses that are available or whenever they would like to see their results, a side menu containing 
            all of the queued business that were a potential businesses will appear. The user can then narrow down 
            their list by removing a business from the list, or click to see directions at any time. The user is then 
            presented with directions from their current location and they also have the option to have the directions 
            sent to them via text message by entering their phone number.

            I was inspired to develop this web application after continually being displeased with using Google Maps, which 
            will populate a map based off of a search term with matching locations around you, but you have to select each one 
            individually, which can be overwhelming in a dense metro area.
          </p>
          <p>
            The technology that went into this web application starts with Node.js and Express.js serving a single GET route as 
            a single page application. On the client side, the users location is determined by the browsers support for geolocation, 
            and if upon failing the user is prompted to input their address, which will then locate them using Google Maps API. Upon 
            submitting the initial parameters, they are posted to the web sever, which then makes a Yelp API request returns the data 
            to the client. The data is manipulated in an array on the client side using AngularJS remove businesses or add them to a 
            selected business array. Due a 20 business limitation from the Yelp API, subsequent requests are sent with an offset parameter 
            to locate more businesses when the user has exhausted the businesses in the current request. The directions are handled 
            through Google Maps API using the latitude and longitude of the client provided from the initial browser geolocation and the 
            latitude and longitude of the business as provided from the Yelp API. The texting service is handled by a API request to 
            TextBelt using a user provided phone number.

      <h3><a target="_blank" href="http://jumbalya.herokuapp.com">Jumbalya</a></h3>
      <h6>Launched to Heroku.com on November 19, 2014.</h6>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="large-6 columns">
          <p>
            Jumbalya was originally written as a Ruby text scrambling method (no password) that I wrote in a night for fun. It worked by 
            taking the original input text and assigning a numerical 2 digit code to each character (e.g. A = 96 and ! = 99), then performing 
            a number of systematic shifts, it converted the input into something visually similar to what it returns now. I sat on the method 
            for a few months until I was finished at MakerSquare before I decided to build it out into a full blown web application with some 
            added modifications that I picked up along the way.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="large-6 columns">
          <a target="_blank" href="http://jumbalya.herokuapp.com">
            <img src="images/jumbalya.png"/>
          </a>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <p>
            One of the things I discovered along the way was SHA-1, a cryptographic hash function that irreversibly but consistently converts 
            any text input into a 40 character hexadecimal number. I decided to implement this into my original design by digesting a salted 
            password with SHA-1, then use the hexadecimal output to control both the shifts performed for the encryption method and the shifts 
            on where to grab the next value from the SHA-1 hash value. Long story short, I'm confident that someone using anything other than 
            brute-force attack, couldn't decrypt the output. But I'll buy you a cookie if you can. Lastly, if for some reason I decide to change 
            the encryption method somewhere down the road, I added in some reverse compatibility by prefixing every output with 'aa'. The original 
            decryption method will recognize the prefix and work accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a working method in place, I decided to deploy 'Jumbalya' as a web application on Heroku with a Sinatra back-end serving it 
            as a single page application with two post routes and AngularJS and Bootstrap to tie the front-end together.
